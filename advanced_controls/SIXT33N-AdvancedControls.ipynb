    "This week, we will first implement port our PCA classifier from the iPython notebook to a file that can be run on the Launchpad. This will allow us to integrate PCA with the rest of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we will revisit controls. Recall that our control scheme for SIXT33N modeled each wheel in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_R[k+1] = d_R[k] + \\theta_R u_R[k] - \\beta_R$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The open loop model has an input $u[k]$, corresponding to the PWM level, and outputs the distance for that wheel. We implemented a closed-loop controller by using the desired velocity and the difference between the wheel distances, $$\\delta[k] = d_L[k] - d_R[k]$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase, we will implement turns by modifying the closed loop control scheme we developed to make SIXT33N move straight."
