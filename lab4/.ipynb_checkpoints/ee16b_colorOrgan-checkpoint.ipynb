    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lab, you will design several filters by choosing desired corner frequencies and calculating appropriate resistor and capacitor values. These filters will ultimately be used to flash LEDs in time to music - your very own color organ!\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a color organ? It is your own lightshow circuit. Check it out here.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5hGF7NsG7Q\n",
    "\n",
    "For our rendition, you will filter three ranges of audible frequencies to drive three LED's that flash in time to the music.\n",
    "\n",
    "The audible range is actually a somewhat small spectrum of frequencies, especially when using only first-order filters (**why might this be a problem?**). Take a look at the image below to get an idea of what range of frequencies we will be working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"width: 600px\" src=\"images/aud-sptrm.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be targeting the Bass, Mid-range, and Treble sections. In the last lab, you measured the frequency response of the speaker-microphone system used in Color Organ. You may have seen that your speakers (phone, headpones, etc.) and the microphone don't create and pick up frequenicies as well on the far ends of the audible spectrum. However, we can compensate for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will define the Bass, Mid-range, and Treble sections as follows:\n",
    "- Bass: [0 Hz] - [100 ~ 500 Hz]\n",
    "- Mid-range: [1200 ~ 1500 Hz] - [3500 ~ 5000 Hz]\n",
    "- Treble: [6000 ~ 8000 Hz] - [$\\infty$]\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**Note that these frequency ranges are *guidelines*. The goal of the lab is to independently light up the 3 LED's using 3 different frequencies. You have freedom to choose (reasonable) cutoffs and amplifier gains. Remember that you measured the frequency response of your speaker-microphone system in the previous lab!**</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "The final circuit will be more complex and have more components than circuits in previous labs. Our completed Color Organ will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"width: 500px\" src=\"images/low-high-band-flow.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "With a band-pass filter constructed like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"width: 400px\" src=\"images/RightFilter.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**Be sure to plan ahead when constructing your circuit.**</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "**A few tips:**\n",
    "- Use +5V and -5V rails on your breadboard. \n",
    "- Use short wires from the power rails to the closest holes in columns A or J on your breadboard.\n",
    "- Connect all equipment grounds and your Launchpad grounds together.\n",
    "- Layout your circuit in a way that matches the block diagram above. Examples:\n",
    "    - Op amp outputs are on the top of the IC, and the inputs are on the bottom. The high-pass filter used in the band-pass filter should be below the buffer (the same side as pins 4 and 5 of the op amp).\n",
    "    - The same op amp IC can be used for the band-pass buffer and for the band-pass amplifier.\n"

    "## <span style=\"color:blue\">Before You Begin: Tuning Your Micboard</span>\n",
    "**Setup:**\n",
    "1. Start by making sure that your micboard is powered by **5V at VDD** and **-5V at VSS**.\n",
    "2. Make sure **OS2 is grounded** and **OS1 is connected to ground by a 100K ohm** resistor.\n",
    "3. Connect an oscilloscope cable to the output.\n",
    "4. Display a **peak to peak measurement** for the current channel on the oscilloscope.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now you are ready to tune your micboard!**\n",
    "1. **Play a pure tone in the midband range** on your phone at a reasonable volume. Make sure to point the speaker directly at the mic and hold it a few inches away from the mic.\n",
    "2. Turn the potentiometer (with a screwdriver instead of your fingers for finer increments in gain) until you see an a sine wave with a **peak-to-peak around 5V** on your oscilloscope.\n",

    "The purpose of this task is to learn how your Speaker-Microphone system will react to different frequencies.  You can refer to your findings for guidance on choosing gains for the amplifiers for individual bands of your color organ. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Make sure the gain of your mic board is set so you get a maximum peak-to-peak voltage of 4-5 volts**\n",
    "Keep your smart phone / speaker at a fixed distance from your micboard. (You will need to place the phone at a distance from the micboard which ensures no audio frequency causes the mic output to rail (hit Vdd or Vss from the power supply).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the oscilloscope to collect the amplitude of $V_{out}$ at each frequency of array freq. We do not have a measurable input signal $V_{in}$, so we normalize the maximum of the frequency response to 1. \n",
